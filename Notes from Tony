General comments: Please don't include `install.packages()` functions in your Rmd code. Doing so throws an error when knitting. Also, your line 243 `z_sample_dist_summary <- bind_rows(z_sample_dist_summary, z_sample_summary)` throws an error when knitting b/c prior to this you have not defined `z_sample_dist_summary`, so you cannot have it as an argument to bind_rows(). I was unable to knit your file without making multiple changes to your file, including to correct coding errors and revise the start and end of some code blocks. In the future, I suggest checking that your code knits properly. Lastly, I'm a bit concerned by how similar your code is to Jenny's (e.g., doing dotplots rather than scatterplots in Challenge 2 Step 4, plus in structure of comments comparing the 95% CIs and code for Step 10, where both of you just included code for bootstrapping the CI for the age variable. I did not penalize either of you for this, but please remember that unless I say it's okay to work together (e.g., for the Wordle programming exercise), you should be working individually and coming to me for guidance if you have questions/problems doing the work. Challenge 1 - 0.85 - Step 4 - When calculating the POPULATION standard deviation (line 64), you should not use the sd() function... that's for the sample standard deviation :) - Step 7 - Please tell me something about the comparison I ask you to make and, in general, use MORE COMMENTING AND TEXT in your Rmd documents outside of code blocks to explain what your code. That is part of the literate programming approach I have been trying to stress throughout the course and keep talking about. Also, please print out more of the intermediate outputs so you can show yourself (and me) that your code is doing what you expect it to, without me having to go and run your code line by line in R to check those intermediate results. E.g., here, you should be printing out (and writing about) the comparison I ask you to make in the rendered output of your Rmd file. - Step 8 - your line 85 (`filtered_movies |> group_by(decade) |> rep_sample_n(size = 100, reps = reps, replace = FALSE`) doesn't quite do what you are thinking it does... here `rep_sample_n` isn't pulling out 100 movies from each decade despite you first calling group_by(decade); rather, it's just pulling out 100 movies per replicate. (You can see this by adding "count = n()" to the summarize step and see that it's only grabbing a total of 100 movies per replicate not per decade within each replicate) It *does* seem like it should do what you think, but in practice it doesn't, and I think that's b/c rep_sample_n doesn't work with group_by :) - Step 9 - what SHAPE are the distributions? Normal? Skewed? Also, this line... calc_mean_sd <- sample_dist_summary |> group_by(decade) |> filter(!is.na(mean)) |> summarise( n = n(), mean = mean(mean, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(mean, na.rm = TRUE) ) ... doesn't work b/c the sd = portion of it tried to take the sd() of the `mean` variable you just created rather than of the `mean` column in the sample_dist_summary dataframe, so all the sds wind up being `NA`. If you were to have printed out your ten_three variable, you would have noticed this. - Step 10 - tell me something about this comparison... what does it reveal? Challenge 2 - 0.5 - Step 2 - Please make sure you print out the summary stats I ask you to generate. - Step 4 - You make dotplots (which are like histograms) rather than bivariate scatterplots (relationship to age isn't really getting shown in your plots) - Step 5: what distribution(s) does it look like Zombies Killed and Years of Education follow? - Step 7 - You don't create another 199 samples, you just set a new random number seed to 199 - Steps 8 and 9 - Not done... in Step 8, there is no "z_sample_summary2" and in Step 9, you are applying the quantile function to "distribution" that contain only 1 element, so the mean, lower CI and upper CI values are all the same.
